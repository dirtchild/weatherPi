# weatherPi
Prototype 2. Reworked all code after first prototype.

This is the software behind a personal weather station.it uses a few adafruit sensors along with a four channel ADC and external senors that arr sold as spare parts.its all very specific to my application,but would be a good starting point foe reuse for others attempting the same.

The code should be relatively well documented. Main purpuse is to:

* Read all attached sensors
* Send to weather underground
* Send to remote databa for custom display

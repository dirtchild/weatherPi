# weatherPi
Prototype 2. Reworked all code after [first prototype](https://github.com/dirtchild/rpi_projects/tree/master/weather.piZero)

This is the software behind a personal weather station. It uses a few adafruit sensors along with a four channel ADC and external senors twhich are sold as spare parts.its all very specific to my application,but would be a good starting point foe reuse for others attempting the same.

The code should be relatively well documented. Main purpuse is to:

1. Read all attached sensors
1. Send to weather underground
1. Send to remote databa for custom display
